// open.
//
// The recorder makes this handler different from every other overlay's: while
// it is armed there are no commands at all, Esc included, because a key that
// still meant something is a key the recorder cannot record. That is safe only
// because arming is one-shot, so the press that gets captured is also the press
// that hands the keyboard back.
//
// The Bindings tab has a filter and the other three do not, so they run
// different grammars: a tab with a filter cannot also spend letters on
// movement, or typing "close" would step through the tabs on its l. Record is
// on ctrl+r everywhere rather than on r on some tabs and not others.
