// It used to read the digit back out of msg.String(), which made the action a
// lie: select_window_3 rebound to f3 parsed 'f' as a digit and focused nothing,
// and there was no way to tell that from the window simply not existing. An
// action that only works on the key it happens to ship with is not a binding.
//
// The same function also used to fall through to corner-snapping when the key
// carried no ctrl and tiling was off, which is snap_corner_N's job and is
// registered as such. Reaching it from here meant a user who unbound corner
// snap got corner snap anyway, from the action they had bound instead.
